    <p class="info name">I wanted to find a name that explained the purpose of the site just in the name.  I started with worldwideweathernow, but realized that was too specific if you were looking for more than just a minute by minujte weather forcast.  So I settled on WorldWideWeatreToday WWW today</p>
